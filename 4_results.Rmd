# Broken and incorrect links

There were hyper links in the sampling frame that did were broken or did not resolve to HREC's web page.

```{r}
tab = tabyl(hrecs, nhmrc_link_resolve) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100))
names(tab)[1] = 'Link resolved'
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%

ftab
```



# CONSORT flow chart

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/4_consort_flow.jpg')
```

The diagram shows the progress from the sampling frame to the number analysed. 

# Recruitment

Plot of recruitment over time.

```{r}
source('4_plot_recruitment_over_time.R')
print(gplot)
# for text
first = min(data$recorded_date)
last = max(data$recorded_date)
days_recruit = as.numeric(last - first) + 1
first = format(first, '%d %b %Y')
last = format(last, '%d %b %Y')
```

The total number recruited is `r nrow(data)`. The first participant was recruited on `r first` and the last on `r last`, which is `r days_recruit` days.

There were `r n_non_consent` respondents who did not consent to participate.

The total number of questionnaires sent was `r n_sent` so the response rate is `r round(100*nrow(data)/n_sent)`%.



# Meta-data on questions

## Time taken to answer questions

```{r}
stats = summarise(data,
            Q10 = round(quantile(duration_mins, 0.05)),
            Q25 = round(quantile(duration_mins, 0.25)),
            median = round(median(duration_mins)),
            Q75 = round(quantile(duration_mins, 0.75)),
            Q90 = round(quantile(duration_mins, 0.95)))
#
ftab = flextable(stats) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

The summary statistics show the time in minutes to complete the online questions. Q[x] is the *x*th percentile.

The very long times are almost certainly due to respondents leaving the browser window open and returning to complete the questionnaire. This is possibly because they had to gather further information. 

## Questionnaire progress as a percent

The table below shows the questionnaire progress as a percent, with the results grouped into four categories.

```{r}
#
tab = tabyl(data, progress_cat) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100))
names(tab)[1] = 'Progress %'
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  colformat_double(j=3, digits=0) %>%
  autofit()
ftab
# for text
finished = sum(data$progress==100)
finished_p = round(100*finished / nrow(data))
```

All respondents completed most of the questions. The number and percent who finished all the questions was `r finished` (`r finished_p`%).

# Questions

### What is your current role(s) on the committee?

Respondents could tick multiple boxes.

```{r current_role}
tab = make_tab_tick_all(indata = data, var_start = 'q3') %>%
  rename('Role' = 'name') %>%
  mutate(Role = nice_rename(Role))
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
#  colformat_double(j=3, digits=0) %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

#### List of other roles given

```{r, results='asis'}
others = select(data, id, q3_5_text) %>%
  rename('text' = 'q3_5_text') %>%
  filter(!is.na(text)) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, '\n', ' '))
for (k in 1:nrow(others)){
  cat('* [', others$id[k], '] ', others$text[k], '\n', sep='')
}
```

There were `r nrow(others)` other roles. We give the survey ID number so that results can be compared with other comments.

### How many full members are on the current committee including the chair?

```{r}
tab  = summarise(data, 
                 n = sum(!is.na(q4)),
                 missing = sum(is.na(q4)),
                 Q1 = round(quantile(q4, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE)),
                 Median = round(quantile(q4, 0.5, na.rm=TRUE)),
                 Q3 = round(quantile(q4, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE)))
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

The summary statistics show the median and first to third quartile. `n` is the number answered.

#### Barplot of committee size

```{r}
bplot = ggplot(data = data, aes(x=q4))+
  geom_bar(fill = 'skyblue', col = 'grey88')+
  xlab('Number of committee members')+
  g.theme
bplot
```

Australian HREC committees have a minimum of 8 members.


## Application numbers

The next set of questions examine the number of applications the committee considered in one year (2023). We are only interested in applications that included quantitative data and/or analysis. Our aim is to estimate the total number of applications considered across Australia in one year, hence we also impute the numbers for committees that did not respond to our questionnaire. 

There were two different options for answering the question.

### Option 1: How many applications did the committee consider in 2023 that included quantitative data and/or analysis? Give your best estimate, and a lower and upper range if you are uncertain.

```{r}
# get mean and lower
tab = select(data, id, starts_with('q6_1_')) %>%
  pivot_longer(-id) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise( n = sum(!is.na(value)),
                 missing = sum(is.na(value)),
                 Q1 = round(quantile(value, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE)),
                 Median = round(quantile(value, 0.5, na.rm=TRUE)),
                 Q3 = round(quantile(value, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE))) %>%
  mutate(name = nice_rename(name),
         name = str_remove_all(name, ' applications with data and/or analysis')) %>%
  rename('Applications with data and/or analysis' = 'name')
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

This is the total number of applications with data and/or analysis and the optional lower and upper range.
The summary statistics show the median and first to third quartile.

#### Results where the mean number was outside the lower to upper range

```{r}
outside = filter(data, 
                 q6_1_2 > q6_1_1, # lower greater than mean
                 q6_1_3 < q6_1_1) %>% # upper less than mean
  select(id, q6_1_1, q6_1_2, q6_1_3) %>%
  rename('mean' = 'q6_1_1', 'lower' = 'q6_1_2', 'upper' = 'q6_1_3') %>%
  select('id', 'lower', 'mean', 'upper')
tab = flextable(outside) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
tab
```

The above table is a check that respondents understood the purpose of the lower and upper range.

### Option 2 part a: How many applications did the committee consider in 2023?

```{r}
tab  = summarise(data, 
                 n = sum(!is.na(q7)),
                 missing = sum(is.na(q7)),
                 Q1 = round(quantile(q7, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE)),
                 Median = round(quantile(q7, 0.5, na.rm=TRUE)),
                 Q3 = round(quantile(q7, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE)))
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

This is the total number of applications and the optional lower and upper range.

### Option 2 part b: What percentage of these applications included quantitative data and/or analysis? Give your best estimate, and a lower and upper range if you are uncertain.

```{r}
# get mean and lower
tab = select(data, id, starts_with('q8_1_')) %>%
  pivot_longer(-id) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise( n = sum(!is.na(value)),
                 missing = sum(is.na(value)),
                 Q1 = round(quantile(value, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE)),
                 Median = round(quantile(value, 0.5, na.rm=TRUE)),
                 Q3 = round(quantile(value, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE))) %>%
  mutate(name = nice_rename(name),
         name = str_remove_all(name, ' percent with data and/or analysis')) %>%
  rename('Percent with data and/or analysis' = 'name')
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

#### Results where the mean percentage was outside the lower to upper range

```{r}
outside = filter(data, 
                 q8_1_2 > q8_1_1, # lower greater than mean
                 q8_1_3 < q8_1_1) %>% # upper less than mean
  select(id, q8_1_1, q8_1_2, q8_1_3) %>%
  rename('mean' = 'q8_1_1', 'lower' = 'q8_1_2', 'upper' = 'q8_1_3') %>%
  select('id', 'lower', 'mean', 'upper')
tab = flextable(outside) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
tab
```

The above table is a check that respondents understood the purpose of the lower and upper range.

### Total number of applications

We combined the results from options 1 and 2 to give an overall estimate of the total number of applications and the uncertainty. We also impute the results for HRECs who did not respond to give a national estimate.

```{r total_imputation}
TeachingDemos::char2seed('everton')
n_boot = 1000
n_complete = filter(data, !is.na(q6_1_1) | (!is.na(q7) & !is.na(q8_1_1))) %>% nrow() # number who completed one option
n_missing = n_sent - n_complete # number of missing HRECs
# 
boot_samples = NULL
data$q6_1_1[1] = NA # TEMPORARY, one set to missing else code will not work
for (k in 1:n_boot){
sample1 = filter(data, !is.na(q6_1_1)) %>% # completed first option
  select(id, starts_with('q6_1')) %>%
  mutate(
    q6_1_2 = ifelse(is.na(q6_1_2), q6_1_1, q6_1_2), # set to mean if no uncertainty
    q6_1_3 = ifelse(is.na(q6_1_3), q6_1_1, q6_1_3), # set to mean if no uncertainty
    q6_1_2 = ifelse(q6_1_2 > q6_1_1, q6_1_1, q6_1_2), # set to mean if outside
    q6_1_3 = ifelse(q6_1_3 < q6_1_1, q6_1_1, q6_1_3), # set to mean if outside
    q6_1_2 = ifelse(q6_1_2 == q6_1_1, q6_1_1-0.1, q6_1_2), # add negligible amount of variance for triangular distribution
    q6_1_3 = ifelse(q6_1_3 == q6_1_1, q6_1_1+0.1, q6_1_3), # add negligible amount of variance for triangular distribution
    r = round(rtri(n=n(), min = q6_1_2, max = q6_1_3, mode = q6_1_1))) 
sample2 = filter(data, is.na(q6_1_1), !is.na(q7), !is.na(q8_1_1)) %>% # completed second option
  select(id, q7, starts_with('q8_1')) %>%
  mutate(
    q8_1_2 = ifelse(is.na(q8_1_2), q8_1_1, q8_1_2), # set to mean if no uncertainty
    q8_1_3 = ifelse(is.na(q8_1_3), q8_1_1, q8_1_3), # set to mean if no uncertainty
    q8_1_2 = ifelse(q8_1_2 > q8_1_1, q8_1_1, q8_1_2), # set to mean if outside
    q8_1_3 = ifelse(q8_1_3 < q8_1_1, q8_1_1, q8_1_3), # set to mean if outside
    q8_1_2 = ifelse(q8_1_2 == q8_1_1, q8_1_1-0.1, q8_1_2), # add negligible amount of variance for triangular distribution
    q8_1_3 = ifelse(q8_1_3 == q8_1_1, q8_1_1+0.1, q8_1_3), # add negligible amount of variance for triangular distribution
    p = round(rtri(n=n(), min = q8_1_2, max = q8_1_3, mode = q8_1_1)),
    r = round((p/100)*q7)) # percent times application numbers
# combine samples
sample = bind_rows(sample1, sample2)
# impute missing HRECs
imputed = data.frame(id = 999 + 1:n_missing,
                     r = sample(sample$r, size = n_missing, replace = TRUE))
# get overall total
total = bind_rows(sample, imputed) %>% 
  summarise(n=n(), total = sum(r)) %>%
  mutate(k = k)
#
 boot_samples = bind_rows(boot_samples, total)
}
# check
if(any(boot_samples$n != n_sent)){cat('Error in numbers\n')}
# histogram
hplot = ggplot(data = boot_samples, aes(x=total)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill='darkseagreen3', col='grey88')+
  xlab('Total number of applications')+
  ylab('Count')+
  g.theme
hplot
# for text
b_mean = round(mean(boot_samples$total))
b_lower = round(quantile(boot_samples$total, probs = 0.025))
b_upper = round(quantile(boot_samples$total, probs = 0.975))
```

We estimated the number of annual applications with quantitative data and/or analysis using a bootstrap approach using `r n_boot` samples. This allowed us to model the uncertainty in respondents' answers. We used a triangular distribution based on the respondents' lower and upper limits and mean.

The mean number of applications is `r format(b_mean, big.mark=',')` with a 95% confidence interval from `r format(b_lower, big.mark=',')` to `r format(b_upper, big.mark=',')`.

### Does the committee currently have a qualified statistician

```{r}
# get two related questions
for_tab = select(data, id, starts_with('q9_')) %>%
  pivot_longer(-id) 
numerator = group_by(for_tab, name, value) %>%
  tally() %>%
  rename('r' = 'n')
denominator = group_by(for_tab, name) %>%
  tally()
tab = left_join(numerator, denominator, by='name') %>%
  mutate(name = nice_rename(name),
         percent = round(100*r/n),
         cell = paste(r, ' (', percent, '%)', sep='')) %>%
    select(name, value, cell) %>%
    rename(
      'Question' = 'name',
      'Response' = 'value',
      'n (%)' = 'cell')
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  merge_v(j = 1) %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

### What are the statistician’s qualifications in statistics?

Only for those who answered that they have a statistician on the committee or have access to one.

Respondents could tick multiple boxes.

```{r}
tab = filter(data, q9_1 == 'Yes' | q9_2 == 'Yes') %>% # only those who could answer question
  make_tab_tick_all( var_start = 'q10') %>%
  rename('Role' = 'name') %>%
  mutate(Role = nice_rename(Role))
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

##### Others

We give the survey ID number so that results can be compared with other comments.

```{r, results='asis'}
others = select(data, id, q10_9_text) %>%
  rename('text' = 'q10_9_text') %>%
  filter(!is.na(text)) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, '\n', ' '))
for (k in 1:nrow(others)){
  cat('* [', others$id[k], '] ', others$text[k], '\n', sep='')
}
```

### Are they currently employed as a statistician?

```{r}
tab =  filter(data, q9_1 == 'Yes' | q9_2 == 'Yes') %>% # only those who answered yes to this previous question
  tabyl(q11) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%

```{r}
tab =  filter(data, q9_2 == 'Yes') %>% # only those who answered yes to this previous question
  mutate(q12 =  as.character(q12),
         q12 = ifelse(is.na(q12), 'Missing', q12),
         q12 = ifelse(q12=='', 'Missing', q12)) %>% # avoid odd missing values
  tabyl(q12) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  filter(n > 0)  %>%
  rename('Response' = 'q12')
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%

```{r}
tab =  filter(data, q9_1 == 'No') %>% # only those who could answer question
  tabyl(q14) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100)) %>%

}
```

There were `r nrow(others)` comments.

### Why don't you have a statistician on the committee? 

Only for respondents who answered that they do not have a statistician on the committee.

Respondents could tick multiple boxes.

```{r why_not}
tab = filter(data, q9_1 == 'No') %>% # only those who could answer question
  make_tab_tick_all(var_start = 'q15') %>%
  rename('Reason' = 'name') %>%
  mutate(Reason = nice_rename(Reason))
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

#### List of other reasons

We give the survey ID number so that results can be compared with other comments.

```{r, results='asis'}
others = select(data, id, q15_5_text) %>%
  rename('text' = 'q15_5_text') %>%
  filter(!is.na(text)) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, '\n', ' '))
for (k in 1:nrow(others)){
  cat('* [', others$id[k], '] ', others$text[k], '\n', sep='')
}
```

There were `r nrow(others)` reasons.

### Do you consider that the committee needs a statistician as a full member? 

Only for respondents who answered that they do not have a statistician on the committee.

```{r want_full}
tab = filter(data, q9_1 == 'No') %>% # only those who could answer question
  tabyl(q16) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  filter(n > 0) %>%
  rename('Response' = 'q16')
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```


### Do you have any comments in relation to the above questions?

Only for respondents who answered that they do not have a statistician on the committee. We give the survey ID number so that results can be compared with other comments.

```{r, results='asis'}
others = filter(data, q9_1 == 'No') %>% # only those who could answer question
  select(id, q17) %>%
  rename('text' = 'q17') %>%
  filter(!is.na(text)) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, '\n', ' '))
for (k in 1:nrow(others)){
  cat('* [', others$id[k], '] ', others$text[k], '\n', sep='')
}
```

There were `r nrow(others)` comments.

### National Statement wording

Only for respondents who answered that they do not consider that a committee needs a statistician.


```{r national_statement}
tab = filter(data, q16 == 'No') %>% # only those who ...
  tabyl(q18) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  filter(n > 0) %>%
  rename('Response' = 'q18')
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```


##### Please explain why or why not

We give the survey ID number so that results can be compared with other comments.

```{r, results='asis'}
others = filter(data, q16 == 'No') %>% # only those who could answer question
  select(id, q19) %>%
  rename('text' = 'q19') %>%
  filter(!is.na(text)) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, '\n', ' '))
for (k in 1:nrow(others)){
  cat('* [', others$id[k], '] ', others$text[k], '\n', sep='')
}
```

## How are statistical concerns handled?

Question wording: ``Consider a hypothetical application. If the statistician advised the committee that the proposed method of data collection and/or analysis were not appropriate to answer the research question(s) then what actions are taken.''

#### The statistician's concerns are discussed amongst the committee

```{r how_handled1}
tab = filter(data, q9_1 == 'Yes' | q9_2 == 'Yes') %>% # only those who have a statistician
  tabyl(q21) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100)) %>%
  filter(n > 0) %>%
  rename('Response' = 'q21')
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

#### The statistician's concerns are discussed amongst the committee

```{r how_handled2}
tab = filter(data, q9_1 == 'Yes' | q9_2 == 'Yes') %>% # only those who have a statistician
  tabyl(q22) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100)) %>%
  filter(n > 0) %>%
  rename('Response' = 'q22')
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

## Optional comments

### Do you have any comments on the role of statisticians on Human Research Ethics Committees? 

We give the survey ID number so that results can be compared with other comments.

```{r, results='asis'}
others = select(data, id, q24) %>%
  rename('text' = 'q24') %>%
  filter(!is.na(text), 
         !str_detect(tolower(text), '^no.?$|^nil.?$')) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, '\n', ' '))
for (k in 1:nrow(others)){
  cat('* [', others$id[k], '] ', others$text[k], '\n', sep='')
}
```

There were `r nrow(others)` comments.

### Do you have any comments on our questions?

# Item-missing data

The plots below show item-missing data with panels that match the questionnaire logic. This avoids data being wrongly flagged as missing when the respondent never saw that question. 

```{r item_missing, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12}
## will likely need updating based on real data

# make question completion patterns
mdata = mutate(data,
